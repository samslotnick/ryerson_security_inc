Ryerson posts/emails its students info about every significant reported incident around campus. I thought I would take that plethora of interesting info to learn how to do some scraping with Python and eventually use a mapping module to display it.
- [x] Loop through/scrape links from pages indexing individual incidents
- [x] Loop through/scrape relevant info from page for individual incident
- [x] Add results to hash
- [ ] Reformat hash values to unified format
- [ ] Record more detailed info using value of binary string
- [ ] Call GoogleMaps API to get GPS coordinates of values at "location" key
- [ ] Pick map module
- [ ] Map Stuff
